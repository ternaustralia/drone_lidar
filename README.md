 -   Ground classification using Cloth Simualtion Filter (CSF) 
-   Generate Digital Terrain Model
-   Normalise heights using ground points
-   Generate Canopy Height Model 
-   Canopy Cover, Canopy Density
-   Exploratory plots
-   Standard metrics
Please note that parameters that are hardcoded (catalog chunk size, resolution, algorithm settings) must be refined depending on study site.
